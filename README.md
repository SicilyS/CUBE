3d Cube Animation

Wireframe modeling is one of several techniques for representing and rendering 3D objects onto a 2D computer screen. 
Wireframe models only display the points and edges of an object rather than filling in surfaces, so they are relatively 
fast for a computer to calculate. Wireframe modeling is used today when a high frame rate is needed and for computer-aided manufacturing.
A complicated 3D object might be represented in a wireframe to make computation easier on the computer and allow easy manipulation of an 
objectâ€™s orientation or position. Wireframe modeling is a more abstract form of 3D modeling, it is less invested in details and therefore
faster to compute and edit from a tech standpoint.
